At this stage, kyc_form object will be created with under_review state. Internally Cybrilla will decide if the particular KYC record linked against the given PAN is eligible for KYC Modification or not. If not eligible, kyc_form will move into failed state with reason = ineligible_for_kyc_modification proof_details_callback_url will take in the URL where you want the investor to redirect back after the Digilocker journeyesign_callback_url will take in the URL where you want the investor to redirect back after the esign journeyPlease note that pan, name and date_of_birth should be as per ITD / PAN records If the KYC record is eligible to be modified, then kyc_form will move into created state. Now, you need to provide all the details needed to complete the form. You can refer to requirements.fields_needed array to figure out the pending details.You will also see a redirection URL present in the proof_details.fetch_url attribute. Use this URL to redirect your investor into the Digilocker page and the investor has to complete the journey to fetch Aadhaar details. Once Aadhaar details are fetched, the same will be used as both Identity and Address proofs. 4.1. In case the proof details fetch fails due to some reason, you can retry the same using Retry proof details fetch API. 4.2. Note that you can use this Retry proof details fetch API only if proof_details.status = failed.You also need to collect a photocopy of the investor's wet signature to complete the workflow. Once you have the same, you need to use the Upload Signature to KYC Form API to upload the signature file to Cybrilla.Once you have provided all the details to Cybrilla, requirements.fields_needed in the kyc_form object will be null. Now, kyc_form will move into awaiting_esign state.Refer to esign_details.esign_url attribute to get the esign redirection link where the investor should complete the esign journey. Once this is completed successfully, kyc_form will move into awaiting_submission state. 7.1. kyc_form can move into awaiting_submission state only if esign_details.status is in successful state. 7.2. You can retry this URL as long as the investor can make a successful esign.Internally Cybrilla will attempt to submit this KYC Form to the KRA and based on this, kyc_form will move into either submitted or failed state. If it moves into a failed state, you can refer to the reason attribute for more details.If suppose investor is not taking any action to complete the KYC Form within 7 days since its creation, kyc_form will move into expired state. You can refer to expires_at attribute to get to know the expiry date and time. If the investor wants to modify the KYC record at a later date, a new kyc_form has to be created and this same workflow has to be followed.
