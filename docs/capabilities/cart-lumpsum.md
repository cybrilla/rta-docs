You can place a lumpsum purchase transaction in a set of schemes (belonging to same AMC or different AMCs) and collect a single payment.

Except for a single payment, each purchase in the cart works the same way as a single lumpsum purchase with its own fulfillment lifecycle.

For a cart of two schemes, the following combinations related to folios, are possible
1. New folio + New folio
2. New folio + Existing folio
3. Existing folio + Existing folio
