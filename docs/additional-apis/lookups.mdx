:::tip[Please note]
- Both these APIs **attempt** to fetch data from third-party sources provided they are available
- Once data is fetched, accuracy isn’t validated. We strongly advise you to share these fetched details with the investor and proceed only after their approval
- You can only fetch these details once per phone number
:::

## Obligations and Limitations for Lookup APIs
- You should be using industry standard, strong encryption algorithms (e.g.,RSA, AES, etc.) to store PII fetched from Lookup APIs

- You should not resell this data fetched from Lookup APIs
- You should not store this data on foreign servers
- You should not lookup data without verifying investors' phone number
- You should not lookup data without obtaining explicit one time consent from investors
- You should ensure that the investor consent text used is the same as approved by Cybrilla and not alter it in any manner
	- Consent text for Bank account lookup - `I allow <partner> to fetch my bank account details using my phone number via Cybrilla and its partners.`
	- Consent text for Customer data lookup - `I allow <partner> to fetch my demographic details using my phone number and name from the credit bureau via Cybrilla and its partners.`

- Cybrilla may audit your implementation at any time, and you will fully cooperate and provide necessary support for such audits

## Go-live checklist for Lookup APIs
- Get an approval from a sponsor AMC with which Cybrilla has signed an agreement for facilitating this sponsorship
- Sign a Lookup offering agreement/addendum with Cybrilla
- Cybrilla will review your implementations and sign-off on the below items -
	- Lookup APIs are not called before collecting explicit investor consents
	- Explicit investor consents are obtained separately for Bank Account Lookup and Customer Data Lookup
	- Cybrilla pre-approved text is used as consent text
	- Checkboxes are provided for investors for opting in (i.e. for providing consent) for data fetch and these checkboxes are not checked by default
	- Your app or any other digital asset is verifying the investor's phone number before invoking these APIs
	- The data fetched is used only for mutual fund transaction processing in the UI workflow
	- Investors have an option to review the data fetched and edit the same
